## 1. Vision Document

### 1.1 Project Overview
[cite_start]ARYAN is a full-stack web platform designed to bridge the "dual information gap" in social welfare[cite: 3]. It serves as a unified search engine that connects citizens to long-term Government Schemes (e.g., Ayushman Bharat) and immediate NGO relief (e.g., Food, Medicine) in a single interface. The platform features a unique **"Anti-Gravity" User Interface** to make the experience engaging and distinct from traditional bureaucratic portals.

### 1.2 Problem It Solves
Many citizens, particularly those from low-income or marginalized backgrounds, fail to receive the support they deserve due to two main issues:
1.  **Information Complexity:** Government welfare schemes are often buried in complex official websites, making it difficult for eligible people to find them.
2.  **Resource Fragmentation:** While government aid involves processing time, local NGOs provide immediate relief, but their services are rarely listed in one central place.
ARYAN addresses this by providing a simplified, single-window platform for both.

### 1.3 Target Users (Personas)
* **The Rural Citizen (Ramesh):** Has low digital literacy; needs financial aid for agriculture or health but finds government sites confusing.
* **The Urban Daily Wager (Sita):** Needs immediate food or medical support from local NGOs during a crisis and cannot wait for long-term government processing.
* **The NGO Volunteer (Vikram):** Wants to list their organization's services (Food drives, Medical camps) to reach more people in need efficiently.
* **The Government Official:** Needs data on which schemes are most searched for in specific regions to improve policy outreach.

### 1.4 Vision Statement
To democratize access to social welfare by creating a zero-friction, highly accessible digital bridge that connects every eligible citizen to the government aid and local resources they are entitled to, presented through an intuitive and modern interface.

### 1.5 Key Features / Goals
* **Unified Database:** A centralized repository combining Government Schemes and NGO directories[cite: 3].
* **Eligibility Engine:** A logic-based filter that matches users to schemes based on input criteria like Age, Income, and Location.
* **Actionable Cards:** Distinct, color-coded results (Blue for Government Policy, Green for NGO Aid) for immediate visual distinction.

### 1.6 Success Metrics
* **Search Efficiency:** 90% of users should be able to find at least one eligible scheme within 2 minutes of landing on the site.
* **User Retention:** A target of 40% of users returning to check for new schemes or NGO updates.
* **System Performance:** The "Anti-Gravity" animations must load under 1.5 seconds on average network speeds.

### 1.7 Assumptions & Constraints
* **Assumption:** Users will have basic internet connectivity to access the portal.
* **Assumption:** Government scheme data remains publicly accessible for scraping or manual entry.
* **Constraint:** The initial prototype will focus only on the **Health and Education** sectors.
* **Constraint:** The "Anti-Gravity" visual effects must be optimized to ensure they do not lag on low-end mobile devices.
